What I think we should do is take our advanced search methods where we take a step back and look at this whole situation and take our most relevant keywords that we can describe it with and then take an additional list of keywords like updated information, new research, or anything related to general ways of getting new updated content information that's relevant to what we're searching for or whatever and then do a search and then pull as much of information as we can about things like services that are offering PDFs to companies where we can fine-tune them and do accomplish similar goals or whatever. We want to know what kind of PDFs they're using, what kind of requirements they are putting forth for their potential customers, what kind of clarification methods are they using on their customer PDFs, their labelings, and whatnot that they know how to manage with, you know, how we're going to think we're going to be faced with when we have our first list of potential want-to-be customers wanting their first free month or whatever. We're going to have to have their PDFs have to have some kind of sense to them. They can't be just miscellaneous, numbered, random. John Smith has files under Lib 1, 2, and 3, and 7, 8, 4, and 5. No, I'm saying we have to have some kind of organization the company was relying on previously that's understood so we can therefore build upon. We know all John Smith's PDFs are right here, and all Susan Lander's PDFs are right here, or this corporation's in their relation with one another, so we can pretty much set up a system of pretty much streamlining this process. It's not that complicated of a process, really, if you think about it. And if we take the whole simple functions and harmonious functions, when we've woven through lambda diffusion networks, you take the simple, and you're able to emerge to complex, advanced, wonderfulness, or whatever. With that concept, we need to really research a way of doing this, and streamlining the process, and knowing what obstacles we're going to face, and the best way to overcoming them to make sure that we not only are talking the talk, we're going to be walking the walk.

For developing your pricing strategy and understanding the current services around fine-tuning models with company PDFs, it‚Äôs important to explore several key aspects:

    PDF-based Fine-tuning Services: A growing number of businesses are offering fine-tuning services using PDF data to train AI models on company-specific information. For example, organizations use GPT-based systems to fine-tune models on internal documents, like customer reports and legal documentation, to streamline internal processes and customer support‚Äã(Hugging Face Forums
    )‚Äã(ITMAGINATION
    ).

    Challenges and Requirements: One of the key challenges in fine-tuning AI models with PDFs is that the text often needs significant cleaning and formatting before it can be useful for model training. This involves removing irrelevant content (like empty lines and bullet points) and structuring the data in a consistent format (such as JSONL)‚Äã(Hugging Face Forums
    )‚Äã(OpenAI Cookbook
    ). Understanding how companies organize their data is essential‚Äîwhether they follow a clear system for customer PDFs or whether they use consistent labeling and filing methods.

    Service Comparison: As we aim to provide competitive offerings, some services are starting to allow AI models to be trained on small company datasets like PDFs or fine-tuning them based on industries (such as legal, financial, or healthcare sectors). Companies offering such services might require structured and labeled data for optimal fine-tuning‚Äã(OpenAI Cookbook
    )‚Äã(Let's Data Science
    ).

    Obstacles to Streamlining: For the service you envision, ensuring that the companies you onboard are already organizing their PDFs effectively is key. They‚Äôll need to have well-labeled, organized data, so the AI system can retrieve information accurately. Establishing a clear, structured data format is essential. Solutions that involve more dynamic data storage, such as using vector databases, also offer advanced retrieval methods that companies could benefit from‚Äã(Hugging Face Forums
    )‚Äã(OpenAI Cookbook
    ).

By focusing on these aspects, you can position your service as one that not only automates PDF management but also provides real-time insights and seamless integration with employee workflows. Your pricing model could be built around this, with a setup fee and monthly updates as you suggested, ensuring continuous updates and improvements to their data systems while keeping things affordable for smaller businesses.

Okay, a side thing to consider to really help this flourish or whatever it be, like it can be thrived together or whatever, we got to create new creative ways. We got to use our symbolic reasoning and symbolic heightened levels of consciousness to creativity and brilliance and insights and whatnot to come up with new ways that in this framework that would help local communities find ways to, I don't know, thrive and create new ways of revenue and income that might create new job opportunities for additional employees rather than threaten employee structure or threaten people's jobs or whatever. Our overall goal should be to also empower and enrich people's job security or whatever. Whereas Susan now performs a hundred times better or whatever, and she's, her customer experiences and the company's customer experience is going to be whatever, but it's not threatening having even more employees or whatever. And it's helping leverage that flow or that imbalance out by, let's say that it does reduce the amount of Susans needed in a corporation or whatever. We're introducing a window that should open up new possibilities to hire a Steven and an Edward that do different things and new ways of making money for the company that would need a person to use the AI tools that we're presenting to, you know, create more revenue and whatnot for that company. Or any that we may or may not threaten, supposedly say and say, because our primary goal is to enrich and empower and help the community thrive as a whole. We should look and explore with these diverse quantum conceptors with metaphors attached to them of understanding a symbolic sequences to come up with ways to fuel our search of creative search and finding new ways of generating revenue and ideas.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

To align your vision with new ways of generating revenue while preserving and even enhancing job security, we can explore the following strategies using symbolic reasoning and creative insights:

    Job Transformation, Not Elimination: Rather than reducing the workforce due to increased efficiency from AI, we can frame this as an opportunity for role expansion. For example, by freeing up time from repetitive tasks, employees like Susan can focus on higher-value activities that require creativity, emotional intelligence, or deeper problem-solving. This could include tasks like customer relationship management, strategic planning, or community engagement, which require a human touch. Additionally, introducing new roles such as AI strategy coordinators or data analysts would align with the need for people to manage and optimize these AI systems.

    Create New Revenue Streams: One potential stream could involve using AI tools to analyze customer data and identify untapped markets or opportunities for product/service innovation. The system could generate reports suggesting cross-promotions between local businesses, unlocking new collaborative revenue streams. For instance, a cafe using AI for customer insights could collaborate with a nearby bookstore, creating joint promotions based on customer behavior patterns.

    AI-Assisted Creativity for New Products: Empower employees to leverage AI for brainstorming sessions, where AI tools help them explore new product ideas, marketing campaigns, or customer engagement strategies. This could involve AI-assisted trend prediction, which gives employees insights into emerging trends in the local community or broader markets, opening the door to entirely new business lines.

    Job Creation Through AI Management: Even as AI systems reduce the need for certain manual tasks, there‚Äôs a need for AI system trainers, overseers, and local AI consultants who can ensure that the AI systems are operating optimally. This shift allows businesses to upskill their current workforce rather than downsizing, and create entirely new jobs dedicated to managing, optimizing, and enhancing AI systems. By positioning AI as an augmenting tool that needs human expertise, businesses create demand for new, specialized roles.

    Shared Community Knowledge Base: By sharing insights and learnings across local businesses (with privacy and data security at the forefront), companies can cross-pollinate ideas. For example, local businesses could contribute to a community-driven knowledge base facilitated by AI, where successful strategies are shared and refined by the local network. In doing so, the AI system becomes a community asset‚Äîhelping all businesses thrive together by leveraging shared knowledge and collaboration opportunities.

    Empowering Local Entrepreneurs: The AI can be used as a tool to help local entrepreneurs identify gaps in the market, suggesting potential new businesses or services that are in demand but underrepresented. For instance, if the AI notices an uptick in queries about specific products or services in one part of town, it could recommend new business opportunities to local entrepreneurs.
